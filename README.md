# Meteor Packacing Discussions

Ask for Meteor integration help, or discuss Meteor 3rd party library packaging.

This repo was created after the initial [community integration thread](https://github.com/MeteorCommunity/discussions/issues/14) got too popular. A good problem to have.

## Guidelines for effective use

1. Please create a new issue for each library you want to package. It'll get the label "library"
2. If you have a general technical question, create an issue as well.
3. We're currently streamlining the packaging guidelines from the [original post](https://github.com/MeteorCommunity/discussions/issues/14) into the [Autopublish wiki](https://github.com/MeteorPackaging/autopublish.meteor.com/wiki). If you see any discrepancies, please report them in an issue.

Cheers,  
@dandv, @splendido, and the rest of the [Meteor Packagers team](https://github.com/orgs/MeteorPackaging/teams/packagers)
